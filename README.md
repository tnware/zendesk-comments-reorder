# Zendesk Ticket Comment Reorder

## Overview

This Edge extension is designed to enhance your browsing experience by enabling additional functionalities. Please note that this extension is currently in its early development stage and may exhibit some limitations and quirks. The extension provides the following features:

- **Reorder Comments**: In a qualifying page (Zendesk Ticket), you can re-order the ticket comments from ascending/newest at bottom to descending/newest on top

## Installation Instructions

1. Enable Developer Mode: To install this extension, first enable Developer Mode in the bottom left corner of your Edge Extensions settings pane. This mode allows you to load unpacked extensions.

2. Extract the Folder: Extract the contents of the downloaded zip file to a convenient location on your computer.

3. Load Unpacked Extension: Open the Edge browser's Extensions settings and choose the "Load unpacked" option. Browse to `/src` in the extracted folder and select it.

4. Extension Setup: Once the extension is loaded, you're ready to use its features.

## Usage Guidelines

- **Reorder Comments**: After the extension is installed, you can show the Extension on your toolbar and activate the Reorder feature by clicking on the extension icon. This will reverse the order of the ticket comments on the current page and scroll to the top. Please see "Known Issues" below.

## Known Issues

- **Multiple Tickets in a Window**: When multiple tickets are open in a single browser window, the extension may exhibit some unexpected behavior. In such cases, you may need to perform a full page refresh to ensure the extension's functionality for the ticket you currently have open.

- **Limited Compatibility**: The extension is currently designed for use when there is only one ticket open in a window. To avoid potential issues, it is recommended to have each ticket open in its own tab or window. Alternatively, you can refresh the page whenever you load a ticket in the same tab as others.

## Future Development

The development team is actively working on resolving the known issues and improving the extension's overall performance. Updates and bug fixes will be released in future versions to provide a more seamless user experience.
